## Overview

The **SBI CyberSecurity Scanner** is a modular tool designed to assist security researchers and professionals in identifying potential vulnerabilities in systems related to SBI. It leverages both a backend scanning engine (primarily implemented in Python) and a frontend interface (using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) to allow interactive scanning, report generation, and visualization of potential security flaws.

This repository is a fork of [Vipul-Mhatre/SBI-CyberSecurity-Scanner](https://github.com/Vipul-Mhatre/SBI-CyberSecurity-Scanner) and has been further developed by Ronit26Mehta to include additional features and improvements.

## Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Uses various scanning techniques to detect common vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separated backend and frontend for easy maintenance and future expansion.
- **Real-time Reporting:** Provides an interface to view scan results and detailed reports on potential security issues.
- **Customizable Scans:** Allows configuration of scanning parameters to target specific endpoints or vulnerability classes.
- **Extensible Design:** Designed to be extended with additional scanning modules and improved reporting functionalities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive web-based frontend for controlling scans and reviewing results.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python  
  The core scanning engine is implemented in Python. It handles network requests, vulnerability testing, and data aggregation.
  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
  The web-based interface is built using modern web technologies to provide an interactive experience.
  
- **Other Tools:**  
  Standard development tools (such as Git) and dependency management systems (e.g., pip for Python, npm for frontend packages) are used throughout the project.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured to separate concerns between backend and frontend functionalities.

### Backend

The **backend/** directory contains all the server-side logic and scanning algorithms. Typical components include:

- **Scanner Modules:**  
  Individual Python scripts or modules that implement specific scanning functionalities (e.g., port scanning, SQL injection tests, XSS detection).
  
- **API Endpoints:**  
  A RESTful API (or similar interface) to allow the frontend to trigger scans and retrieve results.
  
- **Utilities:**  
  Helper modules for logging, error handling, and data processing.
  
- **Configuration Files:**  
  Settings and configuration scripts that determine the behavior of the scanner (e.g., timeout settings, target specifications).

This folder is the core of the application where most of the vulnerability detection logic is implemented.

### Frontend

The **frontend/** directory holds the client-side code that provides the user interface. It typically includes:

- **HTML Files:**  
  The structure of the web pages that allow users to interact with the scanner.
  
- **CSS Files:**  
  Styling files to make the interface clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
  
- **JavaScript Files:**  
  Scripts that handle dynamic functionality such as making AJAX calls to the backend API, updating scan results in real time, and managing user interactions.
  
- **Assets:**  
  Images, icons, and any additional static files required by the web interface.

This separation allows developers to work on the user interface independently from the scanning logic.

### Additional Files

- **.gitignore:**  
  Lists files and directories that should not be committed to version control (e.g., virtual environments, log files, and local configuration files).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** – Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Node.js and npm** – Required for managing and building the frontend assets.
- **Git** – To clone the repository.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ronit26Mehta/SBI-CyberSecurity-Scanner.git
   cd SBI-CyberSecurity-Scanner
   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend:**

   - Navigate to the backend directory:
   
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
     
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Install the required Python packages:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend:**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
     
   - Install the npm dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**

   - Ensure that any necessary configuration files (e.g., `.env` for the backend) are set up according to your environment. Example configurations might include target URLs, scanning parameters, and API keys.

---

## Usage

### Running the Backend

From the **backend/** directory (with the virtual environment activated):

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the scanning engine and expose the API endpoints (typically on a local port such as 5000).

### Running the Frontend

From the **frontend/** directory:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the web interface (commonly at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) where you can trigger scans and view reports.

### Workflow

1. **Configure your scan parameters:**  
   Edit the configuration files as needed to specify target URLs, scan depth, and any authentication tokens if required.

2. **Initiate a Scan:**  
   Use the frontend interface to start a new scan. The frontend will communicate with the backend via API calls.

3. **Review Results:**  
   Scan results are displayed on the frontend in real time. Detailed logs and vulnerability reports are stored on the backend and can be exported or reviewed later.

---

## Configuration

The tool supports configuration through environment variables and configuration files. Common parameters include:

- **TARGET_URL:** The base URL or IP address to scan.
- **SCAN_DEPTH:** The intensity or recursion level for the vulnerability scan.
- **TIMEOUT:** Network timeout settings for scan requests.
- **LOG_LEVEL:** Adjust the verbosity of logging output.

Adjust these settings in the provided configuration file (e.g., `config.json` or `.env`), as per your environment and needs.
